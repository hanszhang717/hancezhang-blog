*This is a redacted excerpt from an internal letter I wrote to my product team. Sensitive info has been scrubbed, but the logic remains.*

**Strategic principles are about trade-offs. They are about how to leverage strengths, mitigate weaknesses, and build a chain of interconnected actions.**

## 1. Step by Step (The Chain of Actions)

The core of "step-by-step" is dynamic perspective switching. We split business functions to avoid bottlenecks, but now we must ensure we don't lose the ecosystem advantage.

"Step by step" means avoiding extreme modularity where teams operate in silos. **Every move must connect.** We are building a chain, not a pile of disconnected bricks.

Every major update must ask: Does this connect with our traffic sources? Does it leverage our creator economy? Are we digging a moat or just a hole?

Coordination has a cost. If one line fails, it drags down the others. We might move slower than a purely modular startup, but we are building the capacity to manage complex loops. By rigorously closing these feedback loops, our ecosystem advantage compounds.

This is also the counter to the "Quick Win" mentality. Do not get drunk on vanity metrics like MAU. **10 users who love you are worth more than 100 who tolerate you.**

## 2. Proximate Goals

> "A leader’s most important responsibility is to identify the biggest challenge and devise a coherent approach to overcoming it."
> — *Richard Rumelt, Good Strategy / Bad Strategy*

Grand visions generate excitement, but also fear. If you only have a 5-year goal, engineers freeze.

We must empower frontline teams with decision-making power, but we must also **reduce ambiguity**. Break the mountain down into climbable hills. Set **Proximate Goals**—targets that are challenging but clearly achievable.

Proximate goals provide the dopamine hit of progress. Product warfare is a long game. You won't get constant applause from the market. Completing small, meaningful loops keeps morale alive in the trenches.

## 3. Ship Often, Ship Early

> "90% of product ideas are bad. The difference is how fast you find out."
> — *Marc Randolph, Netflix Co-founder*

Constant market engagement does three things:
1.  Prevents "ivory tower" development (building things nobody wants).
2.  Uses new products as scouts to probe real demand.
3.  Stress-tests our internal execution.

Product development is a social experiment. The "Genius PM" who invents the perfect product in isolation is a myth. The market is the lab. **Speed of iteration is the only advantage that matters.**

Mark Zuckerberg viewed product as a turn-based strategy game: the secret is simply to have more turns than your opponent.

## 4. Engineers Must Feel the Pain (User Culture)

Product competition is a war of attrition. We need a team that is durable.

If engineers don't care about users, they are mercenaries, not missionaries. Mercenaries flee when things get hard.

**User culture is not optional.** Why?
*   **Empowerment requires context.** If you want engineers to make decisions (which you should), they need to understand the user's pain. Otherwise, they are just following instructions like robots.
*   **Kill the middleman.** Roles that exist solely to pass messages between users and engineers are waste. They add noise and delay.
*   **Build in Public.** Engineers should talk to users, fix bugs directly, and explain their work. If an engineer can't explain *why* a feature exists, they shouldn't be building it.

## 5. Brutal Honesty (Stay Objective)

Long-term competition tests your psychology. The enemy is delusion—either despair ("we are doomed") or arrogance ("we are winning").

**Objectively Assess the Gap.**
Use competitor products. Don't rely on reports. Feel the gap yourself. Don't buy into their PR; look at the product reality.

**Progress is Non-Linear.**
Stop thinking "If I do A, I get B." That’s student thinking. In the real world, you do A, and nothing happens. Or you do A, and C happens. We are not omniscient. We are just guessing and checking. The goal is to check cheaply.

**Negative feedback is gold.** Silence is death. If users are complaining, at least they care.

## 6. Catch the Exponential Waves

**Growth is exponential in the long run, but volatile in the short run.**
We can't predict the breakout moments. We can only prepare for them. We build capacity, we survive the flat periods, and we stay ready to surf the wave when it comes.
