## A Biological Imperative

I didn't choose writing; it chose me.

I discovered early on that I enjoy writing even more than reading. Maybe it’s genetic—my father was a writer turned entrepreneur. I started in elementary school, scribbling poetry.

For me, writing feels less like a hobby and more like a **biological imperative**. If I don't write, I feel a physical discomfort. My mind gets clogged with looping thoughts. Writing is the release valve. It’s not a chore; it’s a cure.

We all know the intellectual benefits: writing structures thought, as Feynman famously taught. But logic isn't what gets you to the keyboard at 11 PM. **Obsession does.** A habit only sticks if it feels like a hunger.

I used to dump everything into my iPhone Notes. But as I left college, the thoughts grew too complex for a jagged list. I needed a bigger canvas.

## Scaling Myself

Whenever I meet an interesting person, I have so much to download to them—usually not news, but learnings, models, and mental shifts.

As my circle grew (a good problem to have), I found myself repeating the same monologues. I realized I needed to **automate my output**. A blog is simply a way to scale my conversation.

It is also the foundation of a personal brand.

I believe personal brand is an asset that is **drastically undervalued in impact and drastically overvalued in cost.** Like any asset, it compounds. The earlier you start the exponential curve, the crazier the backend results.

Plus, let’s be honest: I’m lazy and incompetent at other media. I can’t edit video. I can’t compose music. Text is the only weapon I know how to wield.

## Thinking in Public

I often claim to be bilingual, but the truth is I’m terrible at writing elegant prose in both Chinese and English. (I read Orwell and weep). My English sounds like translated Chinese, and my Chinese sounds like translated English. My natural operating system is a weird hybrid of both.

So, I decided to make this blog bilingual. It’s a forcing function. It forces me to clarify my thinking in two distinct logical structures.

## Remixing Giants

I don't claim to be an original thinker. Most of my ideas are just my own remixes of the giants I worship: Elon Musk, Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Brian Chesky, Steve Jobs, Naval Ravikant.

I digest their wisdom, filter it through my experience, and write it down to see if I truly understand it.
