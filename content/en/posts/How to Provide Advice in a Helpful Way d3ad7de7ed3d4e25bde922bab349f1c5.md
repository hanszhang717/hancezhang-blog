**Asian Parenting** gets a lot of heat for being critical. And often, it deserves it.

Imagine a kid scores **90/100** on a final exam.
Most kids would be thrilled. But many parents react in two toxic ways:
1.  **The Critic:** "Where did the other 10 points go? Why aren't you perfect?"
2.  **The Optimizer:** "Good job, BUT... let's analyze your mistakes so you don't do it again."

Both parents think they are helping. They think they are teaching "Growth Mindset." They think they are nipping complacency in the bud.

**They are wrong.**

What is the probability that the kid listens to this feedback and improves? **Zero.**
What is the probability that the kid feels like crap and stops sharing their wins with you? **100%.**

If your child (or employee) stops sharing good news with you, your relationship is broken.

**The Joy Killer**
When someone is celebrating, and you offer "constructive feedback," you aren't being helpful. You are being a **Joy Killer**.
You are popping their balloon because you have an ego need to be the "Teacher."

**The Dopamine Loop**
If you want someone to grow, you must protect their **Positive Reinforcement Loop**.
Success releases dopamine. Dopamine builds habits.
If you interrupt that loop with criticism, you kill the motivation to try again.

**Stop the Advice Vomit**
Giving advice feels good to the giver. It feels like power.
But unless the person **asked** for it, or unless they are in a state of self-reflection, your advice is just noise.

**The Rule:**
1.  **Celebrate the Win.** Unconditionally.
2.  **Wait.**
3.  **Wait some more.**
4.  If *they* ask "How can I get 100 next time?", *then* you coach.

If they don't ask? Keep celebrating the 90. A confident kid with a 90 is better than a neurotic kid with a 100.
