Naval Ravikant mapped out the hierarchy of leverage:
1.  **Labor**: Hiring people. Powerful, but messy.
2.  **Capital**: Money. Scalable, but requires permission.
3.  **Code/Media**: Zero marginal cost. Permissionless.

I believe we are entering the era of the fourth, and perhaps final, leverage: **Compute.**

### Consensus is a Tax

Managing people is basically "Herding Cats."
To get 100 people to move in the same direction, you need **Rich Consensus**. You need meetings, alignment, politics, and compromise.
**Consensus is a tax on innovation.** It is the price you pay for scale using labor.

This is why "contrarian and right" is a death sentence in a corporation but a goldmine in a startup. In a corporation, being right doesn't matter if you can't get consensus.

### Compute is Permissionless Scale

But now, you can "hire" compute.
AI allows you to outsource complexity not to a person, but to a GPU.
A single person can now orchestrate a swarm of agents to do research, write code, and generate assets.

**The math of work has changed:**
`Output = N (People) * C (Compute) ^ Efficiency`

As **C** explodes, **N** can shrink.
We are seeing the rise of the **Thin Core, Thick Compute** organization.
Look at **Midjourney**. A tiny team of roughly 10 people generating hundreds of millions in revenue. They didn't hire 500 artists. They hired 10,000 GPUs.

They skipped the "Management Tax."

### The Feudalism of Compute

If compute is the new labor, who owns it?
This leads to a "Compute Landlord" scenario.
Cloud providers (AWS, Azure) and chip makers (Nvidia) are the new feudal lords. We are the digital serfs paying rent on their GPUs.

But there is a rebellion: **Digital Homesteading**.
Open-source models (Llama, Mistral) running on local hardware (your Macbook, your gaming PC) are the only hedge against this monopoly.
Running your own model is like growing your own food. It might not feed a city, but it keeps you free.

### Where the Model Breaks

Compute is a silver bullet, but only for "Digital Problems."
It works for coding, writing, and analysis.
It does **not** work for:
*   **Bureaucracy**: You can't use an LLM to get a building permit faster.
*   **Trust**: You can't automate a handshake.
*   **Physical Reality**: GPUs can't pour concrete.

Old-school leverage (Labor, Capital, Politics) still rules the physical world.
But in the digital realm? **He who has the most compute wins.**
