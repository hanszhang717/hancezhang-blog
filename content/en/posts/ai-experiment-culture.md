We’ve all been in that meeting.
The Circular Debate. The "I think" vs "I feel." The HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) deciding the outcome because everyone else is exhausted.

Why does this happen?
Because **Innovation is a Consensus Swamp.**
When you build something new, there are no facts. Only opinions. And opinions are cheap.

### AI: The Validity Engine

But AI changes the math.
It lowers the **Cost of Curiosity** to near zero.
Previously, testing an idea took weeks of engineering. Now? A PM can hack a prototype in an afternoon with Cursor. A designer can generate a working UI with V0.

**AI turns "I think" into "I tried."**

### The Lab Mindset

We need to shift from a "Debate Culture" to a "Lab Culture."

**The Rule:** If you have an opinion, you must bring data.
Don't say "I think users want X."
Say "I ran a simulation with 50 AI personas, and 70% picked X." Or "I built a 10-minute prototype, and here is the log."

**Hypothesis -> Hack -> Data -> Decision.**

This kills the ego. It kills the politics.
When the data is on the table, the loudest voice doesn't win. The truth wins.

### Why This Matters

1.  **Speed**: You stop wasting time in conference rooms.
2.  **Safety to Fail**: When experiments are cheap, being wrong isn't a career-ending move. It's just a data point.
3.  **Democratization**: The intern with a working prototype beats the VP with a PowerPoint.

Stop arguing. Go build.
