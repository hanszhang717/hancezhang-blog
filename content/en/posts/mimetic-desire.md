Dropping out to start a company has become a mimetic trap. It’s the default advice in the AI echo chamber—and like any default, it should trigger your immune system.

The chorus is deafening: *Start a company. Build. Ship.* With figures like Sam Altman declaring this "the best time in human history to build," staying in school or taking a job feels like a failure of imagination.

On paper, the logic holds. The velocity of technology is unprecedented. The market is wide open. And it’s hard to argue that four years of tuition for an increasingly obsolete curriculum is a better ROI than teaching yourself with the god-tier tools we have now.

**But that’s the wrong question.**

The question isn't whether it's a "good time" to start a company. It's whether you actually want the life that comes with it. When you commit to a startup, you aren't just choosing a career; you are locking yourself into a specific, all-consuming lifestyle for the next 3–5 years.

In many ways, I’m already living it, and I love it. But I’m still not sure I should found a company. Why?

**Because "being contrarian" has become its own form of consensus.**

After I got into startups and investing, I became addicted to the idea of being "contrarian and right." Peter Thiel was the gateway drug. And once you read Thiel, you inevitably stumble into René Girard and mimetic theory.

I started to see that in Silicon Valley circles, "being contrarian" and "not caring what people think" had morphed into a new kind of social currency. I even started wearing the label myself.

Independent thinking is non-negotiable. It’s the only way to do great work or build a life that is truly yours. You have to know if you believe something because it’s true, or just because the people around you believe it.

**But in the current AI gold rush, the consensus *is* to be a contrarian.**

The most mimetic thing you can do right now is to loudly announce that you aren't driven by mimesis. You see it at every hackathon and mixer. People are *performing* contrarianism. They dress weirdly, speak with a deliberate edge, and try to seem a little manic—because they’ve internalized that this is the archetype VCs are pattern-matching for.

**Wanting to be seen as a contrarian is the precise opposite of being one.**

It’s a signal that you care deeply—desperately—about what other people think. It’s a costume. It’s darkly funny: once the media decided Elon Musk was on the spectrum, half the founders in the Bay Area started performing autism as a feature.

We are social animals. You can’t just delete the desire for recognition. It’s as fundamental as hunger. I went through a phase of trying to perform "contrarianism." It got me some attention, sure. But it also pushed me into a kind of self-imposed isolation. I felt a need to disagree with people almost by default. The result wasn't intellectual sovereignty. It was just loneliness.

I learned that desire is like any other force of nature. You can't suppress it with pure logic, but you also can't let it drive the car. Both are recipes for misery. You have to learn to steer.

I used to think my old life—the one that followed the "standard path"—was simply wrong. Then I reacted against it, sprinting to the opposite extreme. Now, seeing the trap of performed nonconformity, I’m trying to find the middle way.

**Perhaps the truly contrarian move right now is to ignore the pressure to drop out and build the next unicorn.**

Perhaps it’s to quietly choose the life that actually fits you, rather than squeezing yourself into the costume that fits the moment.
