My engineering lead asked me: "If AI writes code instantly, will we run out of work?"

I laughed. "No. You just met the **Jevons Paradox**."
When steam engines made coal cheaper, we didn't use less coal. We used massive amounts more.
**When AI makes building cheap, we won't build less. We will build 100x more.**

The game hasn't ended. The game has changed.

### The Death Spiral of Debate

Traditional product development is **Debate-Driven**.
Designers vs Engineers. PMs vs Everyone.
"Should the button be blue?" "Is the pricing right?"
We argue because we rely on **Reasoning** to solve **Empirical** problems.
Most of our hypotheses are wrong anyway (Google says < 20% success rate).

### 0-to-1 vs 1-to-100

*   **0-to-1 (The Art)**: Pre-PMF. You need intuition. Taste. Talking to users. Hand-crafting the "10-Star Experience." Don't A/B test a painting.
*   **1-to-100 (The Science)**: Post-PMF. Now you need **The Machine**.

### Build the Experiment Machine

In the AI era, **Momentum is the only Moat.**
If your competitor ships 1 feature a month, and you ship 5 experiments a week, you win.
Not because you are smarter. Because you **learn faster**.

You need to build a system that turns ideas into data instantly:
1.  **Hypothesis**: "Users want X."
2.  **Build**: AI-assisted MVP in 24 hours.
3.  **Rollout**: Feature gate to 10% of users.
4.  **Data**: Validate or Kill.

**This is a generational gap.**
If you are still writing PRDs and holding approval meetings, you are bringing a knife to a nuclear war.

### Technical Debt is Leverage

"But what about tech debt?"
**Tech Debt is Financial Debt.** You take it on to grow faster.
In a land grab, you trade elegance for speed. You pay it back later, *if* you survive.

### The AI Native Mindset: Surfing

Traditional software is building on land. Stable. Planned.
AI software is **Surfing**. The water under you changes every 3 months (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, GPT-5).
*   **Don't plan for 18 months.** Plan for 2 months.
*   **Don't build perfect code.** Build replaceable code.
*   **Don't fight the wave.** Ride it.

**Stop optimizing the product. Optimize the machine that builds the product.**
That is how you win.
