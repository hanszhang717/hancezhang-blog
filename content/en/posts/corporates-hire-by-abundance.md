Behind the glossy career pages and the free kombucha taps, there is an uncomfortable truth about Big Tech: **Most hiring is driven by abundance, not necessity.**

Google, Meta, and Amazon don't hire thousands of people because they critically *need* them. They hire them because they *can*.

Elon Musk proved this at Twitter. He fired 80% of the staff, and the site didn't crash. It kept running. In most tech giants, maybe 20% of the staff are doing the core, revenue-generating work. The rest? They are working on "optionality"—projects that might never ship, features that no one needs, and bureaucracy that exists to manage itself.

**When a company gets rich enough, hiring stops being about survival and starts being about empire-building.**

Think of it like the Supermarket Analogy.
If you are on a budget, you check every price tag. You buy what you need to survive.
If you are a billionaire, you don't check prices. You just grab the most expensive stuff on the shelf because you assume price equals quality.

Big Tech hires the same way. They hoard talent like luxury goods.

**Headcount is a vanity metric.**
For a middle manager, the number of people reporting to you is your status symbol. It determines your pay, your influence, and your promotion velocity. A Director with 200 reports is "more important" than one with 20, even if the team of 20 is shipping all the value.

So managers prioritize **expanding the team** over **efficiency**.

There is also the VC mindset. Wealthy companies treat employees like Venture Capital bets.
"Let's hire 50 PhDs and see if they invent something cool."
If it fails? Who cares. Burning a billion dollars is a rounding error for Google. But for the people hired? It means you are a **highly paid benchwarmer**.

You see brilliant minds doing mundane work—data labeling, internal tool maintenance, endless meetings—not because the work requires genius, but because the company didn't care to optimize the cost.

**Why does this matter to you?**

Because you need to avoid the **Prestige Trap**.
Joining a Big Tech giant does not mean you are essential. It does not mean you are safe. In fact, when the economic cycle turns (like in 2023), the "luxury hires" are the first to go.

If you want a career that is antifragile, don't just look for the biggest logo. Look for the role where your work actually moves the needle. **Don't be a luxury item. Be infrastructure.**
