I’ve been obsessed with Steve Jobs' "reality distortion field" lately. How did he actually do it? The answer lies in a concept popularized by Simon Sinek, but pushed to its absolute limit by Jobs.

Here is the hierarchy of persuasion:
*   **Mediocre salespeople sell products.** They try to convince you to buy a *thing*.
*   **Good salespeople sell a lifestyle.** They make you buy into an *image* of yourself.
*   **Great leaders sell a vision.** They sell the *Why*.

It shocks me how few people proactively ask "Why?" in their own work.

They complain about being treated like cogs in a corporate machine, yet they willingly instrumentalize themselves. They program their minds to function like scripts: receive input, process, produce output, repeat. They rarely question the context, the value, or the purpose. They clock in, do the task, and clock out.

If you act like a tool, don't be surprised when the system treats you like one.

In my team, I use the **7/2/1 Rule** to describe the ideal composition of a business unit:
*   **70%** are focused on the **What**: Execution, inputs, and outputs.
*   **20%** are focused on the **How**: Optimization, process, and efficiency.
*   **10%** are focused on the **Why**: Strategy, direction, and meaning.

(In reality, it’s often more like 85/10/5).

The brutal reality is that we live in a crisis of meaning. The decline of traditional structures (religion, community) and the rise of hyper-capitalism has left a vacuum. People are desperate for a "Why."

If you can be the person who identifies a compelling "Why" and sells it effectively, you gain a superpower. People will work tirelessly for a cause they believe in—often for far less money than they’d demand for meaningless drudgery.

This is the essence of leadership. It’s the move Jobs pulled on John Sculley: **"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"**

Apple’s vision wasn't "we make computers with good GUIs." It was "we build bicycles for the mind." That is a "Why" worth fighting for.

The world is full of smart, hardworking, well-trained people. It is starving for people who can point to the horizon, tell a story, and make everyone else want to build the ship.
