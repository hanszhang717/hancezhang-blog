## How to Manage Your Time

In one sentence: **A leader has one job—to ensure the team produces the highest-value outcome for the company.**

To do this, you must master four domains:

1.  **Objective**: Defining the target.
2.  **Strategy**: Mapping the path.
3.  **Execution**: Removing friction.
4.  **People**: Assembling the squad.

### 1. Objective

I burn at least **40% of my best brain cycles** on one thing: **"What are we actually doing?"**

I read, I study the market, I analyze trends. Why? Because in this era of suffocating change, the cost of working on the wrong thing is fatal.

Productivity is useless if you are running in the wrong direction. A leader’s primary output is **decision quality**, not task quantity.

### 2. Strategy

Strategy is just a fancy word for "How do we get there?"

Great outcomes don't happen by accident. You need a sequence of moves. Without a clear map, your team will burn out on trial and error. Strategy is the bridge between the "What" and the "Result."

### 3. Execution (The Grind)

This is the unsexy plumbing of leadership. It’s repetitive, boring, and endless.

I spend my "lower-energy" hours here: listening to reports, unblocking developers, testing the product.

**I try to eliminate layers.** Indirect reports are information filters. They distort reality. If a product sucks, don't delegate the fix—use it yourself. Feel the pain. If you don't care about the details, your team won't either.

### 4. People

People management feels optional until it becomes urgent. When it rains, it pours.

Sam Altman says hiring has the highest ROI of any activity. My contrarian take? **I don't trust HR to hire.**

HR handles logistics. But **A-players know where A-players hang out.** You, the leader, must be the headhunter. Delegating hiring to someone who doesn't understand the craft is a recipe for mediocrity.

## How to Manage Your Team

My philosophy boils down to two principles:

### 1. Be Detail-Oriented

"Detail-oriented" is often confused with micromanagement. It’s not. (See my post on [Founder Mode](/en/posts/founder-mode/)).

Being detail-oriented means you know the **Ground Truth**. You understand the tech stack, the design constraints, and the user feedback.

**Skip-level meetings are only taboo to mediocre managers.**

Bureaucracy loves chains of command: You tell the VP, who tells the Director, who tells the Manager, who tells the Engineer. By the time the message arrives, it’s garbage.

Go to the source. Talk to the people writing the code. The people on the front lines have the truth; your job is to access it.

### 2. Be Importance-Oriented

Most teams work hard. Few teams work smart.

Your job is to constantly realign the vector. Ensure that 80% of the energy is hitting the **single most critical problem** of the moment.

Only you can do this, because only you have the context of the whole business. If you aren't in the details, you won't know what's important. If you don't know what's important, your team is just burning fuel.
