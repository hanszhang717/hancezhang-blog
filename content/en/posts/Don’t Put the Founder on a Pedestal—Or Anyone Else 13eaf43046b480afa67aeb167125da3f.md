I have deep respect for the founders I work with. I wouldn't be working here otherwise. In my eyes, they are remarkable leaders.

But here is the nuance: idolizing your founder, your CEO, or anyone else—whether it’s Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, or your direct manager—is a trap. The reason is simple: **there are no superhumans.**

### The Myth of Superiority

The biggest myth in tech is that your boss is smarter than you.

People often assume leaders have superior technical skills or higher IQs, and that’s why they’re in charge. But leadership is just a different role. It requires a specific, rare, and difficult skill set—vision, capital allocation, people management—which is why it pays well. But it’s not a higher plane of existence.

In a healthy organization, the leader *shouldn't* be the one making every decision. If they are, it usually means:
1. They are micromanaging.
2. They’ve hired people who aren't actually good at their jobs.

Neither is a good sign. A great leader functions as a **"Router of Context."** Their job is to provide the hidden information you don't see, set the objective, and then get out of the way. Their value is in the big picture, not in out-coding or out-designing you.

Once you realize leadership is a role, not a superpower, you see why putting them on a pedestal is dangerous.

### 1. Idolatry Breeds Instability

When you put a leader on a pedestal, you set yourself up for emotional volatility.

If you believe your leader is infallible, reality will eventually punch you in the face. Leaders screw up. Strategies fail. When this happens, the "superfan" employee often swings violently to the opposite extreme. The worship turns into cynicism.

I’ve seen this "fan-to-hater" pipeline happen repeatedly. It stems from a lack of perspective. If you start by seeing them as all-knowing gods, you leave no room for them to be human. And humans make mistakes.

### 2. Worship Erases Your Value

The best companies are built by extraordinary specialists led by a generalist.

If you believe your leader is a superhuman who could do your job better than you if they only had the time, **you devalue your own contribution.** You start to wish they could just clone themselves. You stop taking ownership.

But if you view your leader realistically—as someone with specific strengths (vision, sales, strategy) and specific blind spots—you can actually do your job. Your job is to complement them.

Great leaders are self-aware enough to admit their weaknesses and hire you to fill them. Bad leaders believe their own hype. But regardless of which one you work for, your strategy should be the same: understand the objective, identify their blind spots, and fill the gap.

### 3. Demystification is the Only Way to Learn

By dropping the idolization, you can finally start learning what leadership actually is.

It’s messy. It involves making high-stakes decisions with 50% of the information. It involves managing trade-offs where every option is bad. It involves anxiety, hesitation, and irrationality.

If you attribute every move your founder makes to "innate genius," you learn nothing. You just watch the magic show.

But if you look closely at the messy reality—the doubts, the pivots, the wrong calls—you might actually learn how to lead.

Most of the time, they are more like you than you think. They’re just figuring it out as they go.
