Steve Jobs had a **Reality Distortion Field**. He could convince people that the impossible was inevitable.
Elon Musk does it too. "Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation."

How do they do it? They use **Socratic Questioning**.
"Why can't the boot time be faster?"
"Why can't we reuse the rocket?"
"Why?" "Why?" "Why?"

But be careful. If you just walk around asking "Why?", you don't sound like Steve Jobs. **You sound like an asshole.**

Without context, Socratic questioning is just interrogation. It annoys experts and destroys morale.
To do it right, you need three ingredients.

### 1. The Crusade (Mission)

You aren't asking "Why" to be annoying. You are asking "Why" because **the mission demands it.**

Jobs didn't torture engineers about boot times for fun. He did it because "Computers for the rest of us" demanded instant-on capabilities.
Musk doesn't push for reusable rockets to save pennies. He does it because "Humanity needs to be multi-planetary."

The mission reframes the conflict. It’s not **You vs. Me**. It’s **Us vs. The Impossible**.

### 2. The Idiot Savant (Curiosity)

You must have **Genuine Curiosity**.
Don't ask questions to prove you are smart. Ask because you truly want to understand the physics.

Jobs and Musk are famous for diving deep into the weeds. They learn the chemistry of battery cells. They learn the supply chain of aluminum.
When you show you care about the details, you earn the right to challenge them.
If you ask "Why" from a place of ignorance and arrogance, you are just a **Suit**.

### 3. The Inception Trick (Ownership)

The best Socratic questioning doesn't force a solution. **It leads the expert to discover the solution themselves.**

People fight for ideas they own.
If you order an engineer to do X, they comply.
If you ask the right questions until *they* realize X is the only way, they **crusade**.

**The goal isn't to be right. The goal is to unlock the capacity of your team.**

Distorting reality isn't about lying. It’s about removing the artificial limits we place on ourselves.
It’s about proving that the only real laws are Physics. Everything else is just a suggestion.
