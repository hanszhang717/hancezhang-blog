[{"content":"We\u0026rsquo;ve all been in those meetings: discussing a new idea, an innovative project, and then getting bogged down in endless debate. Everyone speaks with conviction, citing classics (or perhaps just an article they saw yesterday), but the discussion seems to go in circles, often ending inconclusively or with the decision made by the loudest voice, the highest-ranking person, or the most stubborn. Why does this happen? Especially in the realm of innovation?\nThe \u0026ldquo;Consensus Swamp\u0026rdquo; of Innovation The root of the problem is that innovation projects deal with the unknown. If you\u0026rsquo;re building a standard bridge or optimizing a mature system, experience is king. You can find people who have done similar things, and their experience constitutes reliable \u0026ldquo;facts.\u0026rdquo; Based on these facts, reaching consensus is relatively easy. But innovation is different. When you\u0026rsquo;re exploring a brand-new AI application or an unprecedented business model, there\u0026rsquo;s no existing map. Past experience might not only be useless but even detrimental. At this point, the basis for discussion is no longer reliable experience, but opinions.\n\u0026ldquo;I think users will like this feature.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I believe this technical direction has more potential.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I feel the market isn\u0026rsquo;t ready yet.\u0026rdquo;\nThese are all opinions, not facts. The problem with opinions is that they are extremely subjective, heavily influenced by personal background, information cocoons, and even one\u0026rsquo;s mood on a given day. Worse, opinions are difficult to falsify. You can\u0026rsquo;t logically \u0026ldquo;prove\u0026rdquo; an opinion right or wrong because it often pertains to predictions about the future and personal beliefs.\nThus, discussions based on opinions easily get stuck. Sometimes it becomes an endless debate where both sides try to persuade the other with logic, ignoring that their underlying assumptions might be fundamentally different. Sometimes, when opinions cannot be reconciled, the discussion slides into emotional confrontation, escalating into personal attacks or battles of will, which is devastating for team morale. Another common scenario is that the decision ultimately becomes a game of power or trust, where the winning idea isn\u0026rsquo;t the best one, but the opinion of the person who is more trusted or has more power.\nIn any case, the outcome is extremely inefficient and severely undermines the team\u0026rsquo;s innovative capacity and psychological safety. We waste a vast amount of precious time wallowing in the mire of \u0026ldquo;I think\u0026rdquo; instead of seeking real answers.\nAI: The Engine from \u0026ldquo;Opinion\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Fact\u0026rdquo; Fortunately, we are in an era of explosive AI capabilities. AI, especially recent generative AI and AI-assisted development tools, gives us a powerful weapon to escape the \u0026ldquo;opinion swamp.\u0026rdquo; The key is: AI dramatically lowers the cost and barrier to \u0026ldquo;trying things out.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the past, validating an idea might have required weeks or even months of engineering effort to create a rudimentary prototype. But now, with AI Copilots, low-code platforms, and AI prototype generation tools, a product manager, a designer, or even an operations staff member can cobble together a working demo or complete a preliminary experiment in hours or days.\nFor example, want to know how a specific AI model handles a certain type of user request? Don\u0026rsquo;t guess; use an AI tool to write a simple script and run it. Want to know how users react to a new interaction method? Use AI to quickly generate an interactive prototype and test it with a few people. What these quick experiments produce are the facts we urgently need.\nHere, \u0026ldquo;fact\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean absolute truth, but rather an observable, reproducible experimental result under specific conditions. For example: \u0026ldquo;After using model X, this specific System Prompt, and 5 rounds of interaction, the probability of it accurately understanding this complex instruction is 70%.\u0026rdquo; This is a fact. It\u0026rsquo;s objective, doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve \u0026ldquo;I think,\u0026rdquo; and provides a solid starting point for discussion.\nBuilding an Experiment-Centric Culture Leveraging this capability provided by AI, we can build a new team culture—an experiment-centric culture. The core principle of this culture is simple: encourage (or even require) the rapid transformation of ideas into low-cost, small-scale experiments, and use the facts generated by these experiments to drive discussions and decisions.\nIts operating model is roughly as follows: First, based on an understanding of the problem, clearly formulate a hypothesis. Then, design a small experiment, clearly defining what you want to verify, what prerequisites are needed (tools, data, models, etc.), and how to measure the results. The key is to keep the experiment small and fast enough. Next, use AI tools to quickly conduct the experiment, build a POC, demo, or perform simulations. Once completed, clearly record and share the facts, including the experimental process, prerequisites, and results; transparency is key. Finally, conduct discussions based on these shared facts: first find consensus (\u0026ldquo;We all saw that under condition A, the result is B\u0026rdquo;), which consolidates shared understanding; then identify disagreements and unknowns (\u0026ldquo;Why is the result different under condition C?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;This experiment didn\u0026rsquo;t cover situation D\u0026rdquo;), which naturally become directions for the next experiments. This is a continuous iterative process, gradually approaching the truth of the problem by accumulating facts.\nTo cultivate this culture, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to encourage curiosity and initiative, embrace \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo; experiments (they also provide valuable facts, helping to eliminate wrong paths), emphasize transparent sharing, and focus discussions on the experimental process and data, rather than targeting individuals.\nSo, does this mean completely eliminating predictions about the future and \u0026ldquo;opinions\u0026rdquo;? Not at all. Innovation itself involves imagining the future. The key difference is that in an experimental culture, predictive opinions are no longer castles in the air but need to be explicitly linked to \u0026ldquo;facts\u0026rdquo; already obtained through experimentation. The discussion model becomes: \u0026ldquo;Based on the experimental results A and B that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, I predict that if we try direction C, we might get result D.\u0026rdquo; This way, the basis of the opinion becomes transparent and traceable.\nMore importantly, this culture encourages treating predictions themselves as hypotheses that need validation. When someone proposes a predictive opinion, the team\u0026rsquo;s natural reaction shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be to directly refute or accept it, but to ask: \u0026ldquo;On what facts and assumptions is this prediction based?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;What kind of small experiment can we design to quickly validate this prediction (or its underlying key assumptions)?\u0026rdquo; Thus, predictive discussion is no longer the endpoint, but the starting point for the next round of experiments. It helps us identify the most important uncertainties and explore them at minimal cost, rather than getting bogged down in endless debates about an unverifiable future. This makes opinion discussions also serve the ultimate goal of accumulating facts and reducing uncertainty.\nWhy Is This Important? The shift from \u0026ldquo;I think\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;I tried\u0026rdquo; brings tangible benefits. The most direct is smarter, faster decisions. When discussions are based on facts rather than eloquence or volume, the time wasted on unproductive arguments is greatly reduced. This is followed by an acceleration of innovation—rapid trial-and-error, rapid learning, rapid iteration, which is exactly the rhythm innovation should have.\nOn a deeper level, consensus built on jointly observed facts is far more stable and meaningful than \u0026ldquo;pseudo-consensus\u0026rdquo; based on compromise or power. This is crucial for improving team collaboration and psychological safety. When discussions revolve around facts, negative emotions and personal attacks arising from conflicting opinions lose their breeding ground. At the same time, because the barrier to \u0026ldquo;trying things out\u0026rdquo; is lowered, members who typically \u0026ldquo;haven\u0026rsquo;t done it\u0026rdquo; can more easily participate, contributing their observations and thoughts. And those who \u0026ldquo;have done the experiment,\u0026rdquo; because the facts are shared, are less likely to develop unnecessary superiority. This naturally fosters a safer, more open environment where different ideas can get a chance for quick validation.\nFurthermore, by conducting experiments firsthand, each member gains direct experience, thereby enhancing the entire team\u0026rsquo;s depth of understanding of the problem domain. This way of working also naturally aligns with the principles of efficient communication—first establish consensus, then focus on resolving differences, making meetings and discussions more productive.\nChallenges Ahead Of course, transformation is not instantaneous. Implementing this culture may encounter some practical challenges. For example, ensuring team members have basic skills in using relevant AI tools (tools and skills) might require some training or guidance. The team also needs to learn how to design meaningful and lightweight experiments (experiment design), avoiding experimentation for experimentation\u0026rsquo;s sake. At the same time, be wary of over-interpreting or misinterpreting experimental data (result interpretation). The biggest challenge might come from cultural inertia; breaking the long-standing habit of \u0026ldquo;meetings are for debating\u0026rdquo; requires time and sustained promotion and demonstration by leaders.\nBut these challenges are not insurmountable; they are more like obstacles to be overcome during the transformation process, rather than unbridgeable gaps.\nConclusion AI is not just a productivity tool; it\u0026rsquo;s more like a catalyst that can reshape our ways of collaboration and team culture. By embracing the rapid experimentation capabilities AI offers, we can liberate our teams from inefficient arguments based on subjective \u0026ldquo;opinions\u0026rdquo; and move towards efficient collaboration based on objective \u0026ldquo;facts.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom \u0026ldquo;I think\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;I tried\u0026rdquo; is not just a shift in working methods, but an upgrade in mindset. In an era of innovation full of uncertainty, this might be one of the most important changes we can make.\nWhy not start with your next project, your next discussion, and ask yourself and your team: \u0026ldquo;Can we quickly try this with AI?\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/experiment-culture/","summary":"We\u0026rsquo;ve all been in those meetings: discussing a new idea, an innovative project, and then getting bogged down in endless debate.

Especially in the realm of innovation?","title":"From 'I Think' to 'I Tried': Building an Experiment-Centric Team Culture with AI"},{"content":"Many of us, especially those who excelled in structured environments like school, carry a particular model of the world into our careers. We tend to believe that advancement, like getting good grades, is the result of a fair, well-calculated, numerical system. Do task A, get 10 points. Do task B, get 20. Rack up enough points, outperform others on the scorecard, and a promotion is the logical outcome. This is the GPA model of career progression.\nBut the reality of the workplace, especially when it comes to decisions like who gets promoted or why a customer buys your product, is often starkly different. It\u0026rsquo;s far less about a transparently calculated score and far more about something much more human, and therefore, much more opaque.\nThe Human Element\nThe first thing to internalize is that decision-makers—your boss, your boss\u0026rsquo;s boss, the investor, the customer—are human. Humans are not consistently rational creatures. If people can be wildly irrational with their own life savings in the stock market, driven by euphoria or panic, how can we expect them to be purely logical, spreadsheet-driven entities when deciding on your career or a purchase?\nThe truth is, many decisions are born from an impression, a feeling. The reasons, the justifications, often come later. They are constructed, sometimes unconsciously, to support a conclusion that was already forming. No one likes to admit they operate on gut feelings, especially in a professional context, so a narrative is woven. But it\u0026rsquo;s often story first, reasons second.\nWhat truly sways these human decision-makers? It\u0026rsquo;s rarely just about the tasks you ticked off. It\u0026rsquo;s about deeper, less quantifiable factors:\nTrust: Does your manager trust you? Not just your competence, but your judgment, your loyalty, your character. Shared Values: Do they see you as \u0026ldquo;one of them\u0026rdquo;? This isn\u0026rsquo;t about blatant cronyism, but a subtle, often subconscious, recognition of shared values, perspectives, or even a sense that you remind them of a younger version of themselves. They\u0026rsquo;re investing in someone they feel they understand and can count on in a less tangible way. Playing the Real Game\nIf the scorecard isn\u0026rsquo;t the whole game, what is? It\u0026rsquo;s about understanding the human landscape you\u0026rsquo;re operating in. The most effective way to get promoted isn\u0026rsquo;t just to be a flawless task-completion machine. It\u0026rsquo;s often to help your manager succeed, to help them get their promotion or achieve their key objectives.\nThis requires you to:\nThink From Their Perspective: What are their pressures? What problems are they trying to solve? What keeps them up at night? Expand Your Scope: Don\u0026rsquo;t just focus on your assigned tasks. See the bigger picture. How does your work contribute to your team\u0026rsquo;s and your manager\u0026rsquo;s goals? Collaborate Proactively: Offer solutions to the problems your manager cares about. If you can make their life easier and help them achieve their aims, you become invaluable in a way that transcends simple task execution. Misconceptions That Hold You Back\nUnderstanding and navigating this human element often bumps up against several widely held, and in my view, damaging, misconceptions.\nMisconception 1: \u0026ldquo;This is just sucking up or playing politics.\u0026rdquo;\nMany, particularly those conditioned by systems that reward individual, measurable achievement (like the exam-based education systems), recoil from this idea. They see it as distasteful, a deviation from a \u0026ldquo;fair\u0026rdquo; world where merit is objectively rewarded. They believe the \u0026ldquo;school system\u0026rdquo; – the world of perfect scores and clear rubrics – is how things should be.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the uncomfortable truth: the \u0026ldquo;school system\u0026rdquo; is largely an artificial construct. The world of human interaction, of unspoken cues, of trust built through nuanced relationships – this is the default state of human affairs. It\u0026rsquo;s not an aberration; it\u0026rsquo;s the reality. Learning to navigate it isn\u0026rsquo;t about abandoning principles; it\u0026rsquo;s about understanding the reality. Misconception 2: \u0026ldquo;Maintain strict boundaries; work is just work.\u0026rdquo; The modern emphasis on work-life balance and professional boundaries, while important to prevent burnout and avoid office politics, can sometimes be misused. It can lead to a reductionist, almost mechanical approach to colleagues. \u0026ldquo;They are my upstream; they give me X. I am midstream; I process X and give Y to downstream.\u0026rdquo; While professionalism is key, treating your colleagues – including your boss – as mere cogs in a machine is a mistake. They are people. Perceive their emotions, understand their pressures, listen to their joys and frustrations. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be best friends, but recognizing their humanity builds the kind of rapport and understanding that oils the wheels of collaboration and trust. Don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;gear-ify\u0026rdquo; yourself or others. Misconception 3: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m paid X, so I\u0026rsquo;ll only do X amount of work/thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nMany employees feel that thinking about their boss\u0026rsquo;s problems, or going the extra mile beyond their explicit job description, is uncompensated labor. \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t pay me enough to worry about that.\u0026rdquo;\nThis mindset, while understandable from a purely transactional viewpoint, is incredibly shortsighted. It ignores the power dynamic inherent in most employer-employee relationships. The employer generally holds more bargaining power. If you rigidly stick to \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll only do more if you pay me more first,\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;re likely to find yourself in a stalemate.\nThe reality is, you often need to be proactive, to demonstrate your value and potential before the greater compensation comes. It\u0026rsquo;s not about being exploited; it\u0026rsquo;s about strategically investing your effort to build the trust and demonstrate the capability that leads to greater opportunities and rewards. Those who only focus on the immediate direct exchange often miss the bigger game. The world of work, like much of life, is governed by these less obvious, more human dynamics. Recognizing this isn\u0026rsquo;t about cynicism; it\u0026rsquo;s about effectiveness. It\u0026rsquo;s about understanding that true advancement often comes not from acing a test, but from building trust, understanding people, and helping them succeed.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/the-scorecard-fallacy/","summary":"Your stellar performance review isn\u0026rsquo;t the key to promotion; the real secret lies in understanding the humans making the decision.","title":"The Scorecard Fallacy: How Promotion Decisions Are Really Made"},{"content":"There\u0026rsquo;s an uncomfortable truth hidden behind the glossy careers pages of big tech companies: most of their hiring isn\u0026rsquo;t driven by genuine necessity, but by abundance.\nCompanies like Google, Meta, or Amazon don\u0026rsquo;t add thousands of new hires every year because each employee is critically essential. They hire simply because they can afford to. Elon Musk illustrated this dramatically at Twitter—laying off 80% of the workforce had surprisingly little impact on the core product. In most tech companies, perhaps only 20% of employees work on truly vital, revenue-driving projects. Google\u0026rsquo;s search and ads make up the lion\u0026rsquo;s share of its revenue, yet only a fraction of its workforce is directly tied to these core areas. Meanwhile, entire teams work on projects that might never ship—projects that are less about necessity and more about optionality.\nWhen companies grow sufficiently rich, hiring stops being about careful selection and becomes something closer to empire-building. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer about who you genuinely need, but rather about who you can afford.\nThink of it like shopping at a supermarket. On a tight budget, you meticulously compare prices, check ingredients, and judge nutritional value. But if you have millions, you won\u0026rsquo;t bother looking carefully. You grab the most expensive items on the shelf, believing price correlates directly with quality—even if it often doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Big companies hire the same way. With abundant resources, they don\u0026rsquo;t thoroughly evaluate the necessity of each new hire. Instead, they hire expensive talent, assuming higher salaries automatically guarantee better results.\nHiring becomes a kind of strategic luxury. Managers don\u0026rsquo;t just expand teams to tackle workloads—they expand to signal their own status and pave the way for promotions. The number of people reporting to a manager usually determines that manager\u0026rsquo;s perceived value and salary within the organization. The head of a 200-person division has more influence, status, and earning potential than someone managing just 20, regardless of how many of those employees genuinely contribute to the company’s core success.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also optionality at play. Wealthy companies treat hiring as venture capital bets: low-risk investments with potentially huge returns. Many hires are \u0026ldquo;hope it works\u0026rdquo; bets rather than carefully calculated moves. Occasionally, these speculative bets become game-changers—like Google\u0026rsquo;s early investment in AI—but most don\u0026rsquo;t pan out. When a company earns hundreds of billions annually, burning a billion dollars on speculative projects isn\u0026rsquo;t catastrophic—though the same spending would be ruinous for a startup. This mentality often results in highly-qualified people performing mundane tasks: PhDs labeling datasets, master\u0026rsquo;s degree holders managing routine operations—not because these roles demand such expertise, but because optimization for cost-effectiveness isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary.\nWhy should this matter to you? Because it breaks down a dangerous illusion: joining a prestigious tech giant doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean you\u0026rsquo;re indispensable, valuable, or even secure. History shows, especially vividly around economic downturns (such as the cycle around 2021), that these companies expand and contract largely due to macroeconomic factors like interest rates—not employee performance. When layoffs inevitably occur, the first casualties are often these \u0026ldquo;luxury hires,\u0026rdquo; employees whose roles were never central to the company\u0026rsquo;s essential success.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re charting your career, particularly early on, understanding this is crucial. Prestige alone can be misleading. Often, the smarter move isn\u0026rsquo;t boarding the largest, most prestigious ship—but one where your work visibly affects the company\u0026rsquo;s trajectory. Seek roles clearly linked to core business outcomes. Find positions where your individual impact is tangible and measurable, not buried beneath layers of internal politics.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/big-tech-hiring/","summary":"Big-tech hiring is driven by excess, not necessity.","title":"Corporates Hire by Abundance, Not by Necessity"},{"content":"People are often amazed by leaders like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk—leaders who seem to bend reality itself to their will. There\u0026rsquo;s even a phrase for it: the Reality Distortion Field (RDF). But what exactly makes this approach so powerful, and why does it seem to work where others fail?\nSteve Jobs was famous for walking into rooms filled with skeptical engineers and walking out leaving a team convinced they could achieve something they\u0026rsquo;d previously considered impossible. Take the early days of the Macintosh. Jobs didn\u0026rsquo;t just demand excellence; he relentlessly questioned assumptions. When engineers argued that the boot-up sequence couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly be faster, Jobs asked, repeatedly, \u0026ldquo;Why not? What if you had no choice?\u0026rdquo; By removing these implicit constraints, Jobs forced his team to find capabilities within themselves they didn\u0026rsquo;t know existed.\nElon Musk uses a similar strategy at SpaceX and Tesla. An engineer might say rockets can\u0026rsquo;t be reused, or batteries can\u0026rsquo;t be produced cheaply enough for mass-market electric cars. Musk responds: \u0026ldquo;Why not? What\u0026rsquo;s stopping us?\u0026rdquo; Behind these questions is Musk\u0026rsquo;s famous refrain: \u0026ldquo;Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.\u0026rdquo; Musk isn\u0026rsquo;t recklessly ignoring reality; he\u0026rsquo;s carefully distinguishing true limitations (physics) from assumptions masquerading as laws.\nBoth Jobs and Musk employ what philosophers call Socratic questioning. Yet people often misunderstand how it works. Merely repeating \u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. Without genuine curiosity and a shared purpose, these questions quickly become annoying or, worse, insulting to the very experts whose cooperation you need. True Socratic questioning isn\u0026rsquo;t about cornering experts or challenging their authority for its own sake. It\u0026rsquo;s about refining knowledge and igniting deeper motivation through collaborative inquiry.\nEffective Socratic questioning involves three critical ingredients:\nFirst, being mission-driven is essential. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just a motivational slogan. A compelling mission provides context and direction, turning seemingly annoying questions into logical, necessary inquiries. Jobs wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to torment engineers by demanding faster boot times; he was aligning every question with the mission of creating \u0026ldquo;computers for the rest of us.\u0026rdquo; Musk doesn\u0026rsquo;t insist on rocket reusability simply to frustrate his engineers; he does it to enable humanity\u0026rsquo;s future on Mars. The mission clarifies the intent behind the questions, transforming what might seem confrontational into collaborative exploration. When the leader says, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m asking this question to help us achieve our mission,\u0026rdquo; it reframes the dialogue from conflict to shared ambition.\nSecond, you must maintain genuine curiosity—a beginner\u0026rsquo;s mindset. This means asking questions to truly understand, not to prove you\u0026rsquo;re smarter. Jobs often asked questions about technical details because he genuinely wanted to understand them himself. Musk similarly spends significant time diving into the physics and engineering complexities alongside his teams. This genuine curiosity fosters trust and openness, turning skeptical engineers into collaborative partners.\nThird, effective questioning leads the respondent to breakthroughs they feel are their own ideas. Psychologically, people are far more committed to ideas they believe they originated themselves. When a leader guides an expert toward a solution through insightful questioning, the expert feels personal ownership. This dramatically increases motivation and creativity compared to a scenario where solutions are handed down from above.\nOf course, questions alone aren\u0026rsquo;t enough. Jobs didn\u0026rsquo;t just ask questions—he backed them with action, visibly investing resources into prototype development. Musk similarly puts immense personal risk and capital behind his questions. Actions demonstrate commitment far better than words alone, proving to teams that the questions aren\u0026rsquo;t idle or academic.\nWhen used thoughtfully, Socratic questioning doesn\u0026rsquo;t just distort reality—it transforms it. It pushes teams beyond imagined limitations, empowering them to redefine what\u0026rsquo;s possible.\nDistorting reality effectively isn\u0026rsquo;t about denying facts. It\u0026rsquo;s about clarifying them—distinguishing between immutable laws and human-made constraints. Steve Jobs and Elon Musk achieved greatness not by ignoring reality, but by persistently reframing their team\u0026rsquo;s perception of what reality actually allows. By changing the questions their teams asked, they changed the very nature of what their teams believed was achievable.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/rdf/","summary":"Simply doing Socratic questioning can be simply annoying.","title":"Socratic Questioning and the Reality Distortion Field"},{"content":"The best businesses, the ones that really change things, often aren\u0026rsquo;t built for the experts. They\u0026rsquo;re built for everyone else. They take the messy, complicated stuff that only a few truly understand and make it so simple that the other 90% of the world can use it without thinking twice. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about dumbing things down. It\u0026rsquo;s about unlocking potential on a massive scale.\nThe Danger of \u0026ldquo;Technology-First\u0026rdquo; Mindset It\u0026rsquo;s a natural instinct, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re good at something, to want to build for people like you. Engineers want to build for engineers. You get the jargon, the pain points, the subtle details. But here\u0026rsquo;s the catch: building for experts is often a surprisingly under-appreciated task. They\u0026rsquo;re a tough crowd. They know what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about, which means they\u0026rsquo;ll spot every flaw. They can, and will, compare you to every other option out there. And because they could probably build a version of what you\u0026rsquo;re selling themselves, they\u0026rsquo;re not always eager to pay top dollar. It\u0026rsquo;s a world of razor-thin margins and fleeting loyalty.\nYou see this pattern everywhere, not just in software. Think about skincare. Dermatologists will tell you that most of the fancy stuff is unnecessary. A basic routine is often all you need. Yet, the shelves are overflowing with elixirs and multi-step regimens promising miracles. Why? Because for many, it\u0026rsquo;s not just about the science; it\u0026rsquo;s about the ritual, the feeling of control, the story the product tells. Most people aren\u0026rsquo;t biochemists; they\u0026rsquo;re buying hope, or a moment of self-care, packaged in a nice bottle. It\u0026rsquo;s tempting for those who do understand the science to be condescending, to dismiss these consumers as uninformed. But this is a dangerous path, a manifestation of the \u0026ldquo;technology-first\u0026rdquo; mindset. The reality is that the commercial world is driven by user perception and needs, not by an engineer\u0026rsquo;s definition of what users should want or understand. Believing users are simply \u0026ldquo;stupid\u0026rdquo; for not grasping technical nuances is a fast track to building something nobody cares.\nOr consider consumer electronics. We all know that person, the audiophile or the PC builder, who can list a dozen reasons why the popular mainstream product is technically inferior. They\u0026rsquo;ve done the research. They understand the specs. But most people don\u0026rsquo;t buy a speaker because of its frequency response curve. They buy it because it looks good, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to use, and it makes their music sound a bit better. They might not even know exactly what they want, beyond a vague desire for something nice. If you only market to the spec-obsessed, you\u0026rsquo;re talking to a very tiny fraction of the potential audience, also perhaps the most picky ones.\nThe Legend of Apple The early days of Apple illustrate this tension perfectly. Steve Wozniak, an engineering wizard, created Apple I boards that were marvels of ingenuity, elegant in a way only fellow engineers truly appreciated. His designs allowed one to see the logic, trace signals, and understand component interactions. This thrilled the Homebrew Computer Club, tech enthusiasts who loved to tinker, solder, and grasp every circuit. For them, a computer was an open invitation, not a sealed box. They craved modularity: the ability to swap components, experiment with expansion cards, and connect custom peripherals to the system bus. Wozniak\u0026rsquo;s bare-bones designs, with exposed parts, perfectly served this hunger for control, transparency, and endless modification. Users bought the board, sourced their own parts, and the real joy was in building their system.\nJobs saw computers extending beyond the hobbyist niche, accessible even to those unfamiliar with soldering irons or hexadecimal code. To sell the Apple I, he insisted on an assembled motherboard—an idea almost heretical to the Homebrew crowd. He even envisioned a complete, all-in-one machine: take it out of the box, plug it in, and use it. This was a leap. The Homebrew enthusiasts were unimpressed, questioning why they should pay for assembly they could do themselves, preferring open, modifiable systems where they could see the \u0026ldquo;guts.\u0026rdquo; While Wozniak\u0026rsquo;s genius captivated this specific group, Jobs pushed for a product appealing to a much broader audience who didn\u0026rsquo;t know or care what a microprocessor looked like, let alone how to interface with its address lines. Jobs understood that most people didn\u0026rsquo;t want to build computers; they wanted to use them—to write, learn, create. Apple\u0026rsquo;s eventual genius and its path to ubiquity stemmed not just from Woz\u0026rsquo;s technical brilliance, but from Jobs\u0026rsquo; relentless drive to hide that complexity, making the powerful feel effortless for everyone else.\nJony Ive and the Aesthetics of Simplicity This brings us to what simplicity actually means. It\u0026rsquo;s not just about making things look clean. Jony Ive, the former Head of Design at Apple, cautioned that just chasing minimalism can lead to \u0026ldquo;desiccated, soulless\u0026rdquo; products. For Ive, real simplicity had to have utility: \u0026ldquo;If something does not have utility, it\u0026rsquo;s just ugly.\u0026rdquo;\nHe further elaborated on the difficulty of achieving true simplicity. The hard part, Ive said, is first \u0026ldquo;identifying what\u0026rsquo;s truly important.\u0026rdquo; And then, even harder, \u0026ldquo;compressing the complex.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not about stripping features away randomly. It\u0026rsquo;s about deeply understanding the core purpose of something and then finding the most direct path to its essence.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re building something, it\u0026rsquo;s tempting to get caught up in the cleverness of your solution, the elegance of your code, the power of your features. We all do it. But the market rarely rewards raw technical prowess alone. It rewards things that solve real problems for real people, easily. If your product requires a manual the size of a phone book, most people will give up. They\u0026rsquo;re not looking for a new intellectual challenge; they\u0026rsquo;re looking for a tool that makes their life a little bit better, right now.\nSo, the next time you see a product that seems \u0026ldquo;too simple\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not advanced enough,\u0026rdquo; pause for a moment. It might not be a compromise. It might be a sign of profound insight. It might be that the creators understood something crucial: that the biggest opportunities often lie in taking the power that was once locked away with the experts and giving it to everyone. That\u0026rsquo;s not just good design; it\u0026rsquo;s often great business. The real magic isn\u0026rsquo;t in the complexity you can build, but in the complexity you can hide.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/the-heresy-of-simplicity/","summary":"The best businesses make complexity invisible.","title":"The Heresy of Simplicity"},{"content":"Nassim Taleb says the world is mostly random. Black Swans, pure chance – trying to predict things is a waste of time. Then Peter Thiel, in Zero to One, says great companies are all about careful, deliberate design.\nSo, which is it? If the world\u0026rsquo;s a crapshoot, why bother designing anything?\nWhat \u0026ldquo;Design\u0026rdquo; Really Means\nThe confusion probably starts with what we mean by \u0026ldquo;design.\u0026rdquo; We often think of a perfect blueprint, a detailed plan we follow step-by-step to a known future. If that\u0026rsquo;s design, then yes, in a random world, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly useless.\nBut what if real design isn\u0026rsquo;t about predicting the future? What if it\u0026rsquo;s about building a system that can handle shocks, maybe even get stronger from them? What if it\u0026rsquo;s about what Taleb calls \u0026ldquo;antifragility\u0026rdquo;?\nAntifragile Design: Look at Apple\nSteve Jobs\u0026rsquo; Apple is a good way to see this. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to think Jobs had a crystal ball for tech trends. I doubt it. What Apple got good at was designing a super flexible ecosystem.\nThe App Store is a classic case. Apple didn\u0026rsquo;t know which apps would win. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have to. They just built a platform where thousands of developers could try things out for millions of users. The good stuff rose to the top. So when smartphones became media players, wallets, or AR viewers, Apple didn\u0026rsquo;t need to see it all coming. Their ecosystem was built to let these things happen. Apple wasn\u0026rsquo;t just reacting; they were set up to benefit from whatever came next.\nThat wasn\u0026rsquo;t luck. It was, I bet, a deep grasp of antifragile ideas. Jobs didn\u0026rsquo;t try to nail down one future; he designed for many possibilities by building in options.\nSimplicity is another way to be antifragile. Complex things break easily. More features, more parts, mean more ways for things to go wrong, especially when something unexpected happens. Early smartphones with all their buttons looked clunky fast as new apps appeared. Apple\u0026rsquo;s simple multi-touch screen could handle almost anything. Same with code: tangled code is a disaster when things change; simple, modular code adapts.\nApple often designed by removing stuff. Not just for looks. It was about giving unforeseen problems fewer places to hide. A simpler product is nimbler when the world changes. It\u0026rsquo;s smart defense. It leaves more room for the future, whatever it brings.\nAnd Jobs bet on things that don\u0026rsquo;t change much: people like beauty, ease of use, things that just work. Technology zips along, hard to predict. But what people find elegant? That changes slowly. Betting on those constants is antifragile.\nAntifragility\u0026rsquo;s Two Moves: Building It, Then Riding It\nSo how do these antifragile systems get built? They don\u0026rsquo;t just happen. It takes two kinds of effort, often at different times.\nFirst, there\u0026rsquo;s the sheer force of creation. To build something powerful and antifragile, like Apple\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem or any company from scratch, takes a huge, almost unreasonable push. This is Sam Altman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;willfulness.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;zero to one.\u0026rdquo; You need almost crazy self-belief when everyone else says it won\u0026rsquo;t work. You have to grind, to push through, to make an idea real. Altman notes that the most successful founders often believe in themselves to the point of delusion, think for themselves, take risks, and focus intensely. They know creating something worthwhile often means failing a lot to get one big win. You can\u0026rsquo;t just wait for luck when you\u0026rsquo;re starting with nothing. \u0026ldquo;Design\u0026rdquo; here is messy, iterative, and powered by grit.\nThen, there\u0026rsquo;s strategic patience: riding the wave. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve built your antifragile system, if you get lucky and catch a giant wave – like Apple did with mobile and apps – the smart move might change. This is where \u0026ldquo;Strategic Stillness\u0026rdquo; comes in. Consider Cisco. The founders, Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosack, did the brutal work of building something new – routers, back when networked computers were just starting. They fought through startup hell, got rejected by VCs endlessly, but finally launched. Then, Cisco went public in 1990. Conflicts with new management arose, and they sold most of their stock for about $170 million. Sounds great, right? But the internet was about to explode, something few could really see in 1990. Cisco\u0026rsquo;s stock shot up nearly a thousand times by 2000. That $170 million could have been tens of billions. They nailed the creation part. But holding on, letting that massive wave of compounding do its thing? That\u0026rsquo;s a different, often harder, game.\nThis \u0026ldquo;strategic stillness\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t about being lazy. It\u0026rsquo;s about seeing that what you\u0026rsquo;ve built, plus the trend it\u0026rsquo;s on, has its own powerful momentum. Too much meddling now can actually hurt. Your initial design did its job; now it\u0026rsquo;s about letting that design and the trend compound.\nFounders or investors who sell out too early from huge successes, like at Cisco, are often masters of that first, willful creation. But they might stumble on strategic patience. Maybe the exhaustion of building, the daily battles, blinds them to the slower, massive opportunity that just needs time. They grab the sure thing now, missing a far bigger, if less certain, payoff later.\nReal Design: For Options and Leverage\nSo, back to the first question: does design matter in a random world? Yes, a lot. But it\u0026rsquo;s not what we usually think.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not about planning a fixed future. It\u0026rsquo;s about building a flexible setup that keeps benefiting from surprises. This means two things:\nActively Build the Base: Use sheer will to create an antifragile system from nothing. This lays the groundwork. It takes focus, hard work, and fierce belief. Wisely Ride the Current: Once it\u0026rsquo;s working and has momentum, see and use its potential and any big trends. This means strategic patience, letting compounding work. That takes vision, understanding, and the guts to wait. Apple\u0026rsquo;s story has both: Jobs\u0026rsquo;s early, forceful drive, and the later ecosystem that grew by harnessing everyone else\u0026rsquo;s work – a compounding machine.\nDesign Your Approach, Not Destination\nIn a world that keeps surprising you, \u0026ldquo;design\u0026rdquo; becomes less about the specific thing you\u0026rsquo;re making and more about how you make things, how you adapt. You stop trying to fight randomness. You learn to work with it, maybe even use it. You\u0026rsquo;re not drawing a perfect map. You\u0026rsquo;re building a tough, adaptable ship, and learning when to raise the sails and when to drop anchor.\nIn the end, building a startup, investing, or just living your life – the most important design might be how you design your way through uncertainty.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/designing-anti-fragility/","summary":"How to build systems that grow stronger from randomness.","title":"Designing Anti-fragility"},{"content":"Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO of Airbnb, has often championed the idea of \u0026ldquo;Founder Mode,\u0026rdquo; a concept popularized by Paul Graham.\nI was immediately drawn to this concept when I first encountered it, but at the time, I interpreted it too narrowly. I thought it simply meant being hands-on rather than hands-off—a shallow view of a profound leadership mindset. This misunderstanding stemmed from Graham\u0026rsquo;s comparison of Founder Mode with \u0026ldquo;Manager Mode,\u0026rdquo; where leaders take a step back, focusing primarily on managing people rather than engaging directly with the work. The hands-on versus hands-off framing felt straightforward, especially since I\u0026rsquo;d seen similar principles in Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s management philosophy. Musk requires engineering managers to spend at least 20% of their time doing actual engineering. My initial takeaway from this was that leaders need to stay close to the frontlines to understand what\u0026rsquo;s happening and avoid \u0026ldquo;leading without knowing.\u0026rdquo;\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I encountered leadership challenges in my own work that my understanding of Founder Mode deepened. Around this time, I came across an interview with Brian Chesky that reshaped my thinking. If you manage a team larger than ten people or one with multiple functional units, I highly recommend watching this interview in full—don\u0026rsquo;t double-speed through it.\nBrian distilled Founder Mode into a single sentence: \u0026ldquo;Great leadership is not absence; it\u0026rsquo;s presence.\u0026rdquo; At first, this might sound like the hands-on/hands-off distinction, but Brian\u0026rsquo;s reasoning went deeper than simply understanding the frontlines.\nHe explained this with the analogy of rowing a boat as a team. The goal—rowing forward—sounds simple enough. But in practice, merely stating this goal doesn\u0026rsquo;t suffice. That\u0026rsquo;s why, in rowing, there\u0026rsquo;s often someone at the front of the boat giving real-time guidance. If leaders provide a grand vision and then hand off autonomy to their teams, it can lead to chaos—contrary to what many business schools teach: \u0026ldquo;Hire great people and let them make the decisions.\u0026rdquo; Brian shared that at Airbnb, when different teams worked on the same overarching goal but had too much autonomy, they often ended up with different tech stacks, product designs, and processes that didn\u0026rsquo;t integrate. They were effectively operating as separate organizations. I\u0026rsquo;ve faced this exact issue myself.\nReturning to the rowing analogy, even if everyone is aligned on rowing \u0026ldquo;north,\u0026rdquo; some might row 15% northeast at two strokes per second, while others row 10% northwest at three strokes per second. Everyone is working hard and toward the same goal, but the boat\u0026rsquo;s forward momentum is inefficient. From a physics perspective, the net force driving the boat forward is diluted.\nThis is where Founder Mode becomes critical. Brian pointed to Steve Jobs as a prime example. Jobs didn\u0026rsquo;t simply delegate problems and trust his teams to solve them independently. Instead, he immersed himself in the details of crucial projects—not to micromanage but to collaborate. Leaders in Founder Mode don\u0026rsquo;t act as decision-makers for every issue; they partner with their teams, ensuring alignment with the organization\u0026rsquo;s strategy. This involves providing a clear vision, adding context, and helping to unify efforts across teams. Importantly, Jobs wasn\u0026rsquo;t there to control every decision but to guide and amplify the team\u0026rsquo;s work. This echoes with my previous article Don\u0026rsquo;t Put the Founder on a Pedestal—Or Anyone Else that leaders need to figure out their position and in what way they can best contribute to the team.\nThe secret to avoiding micromanagement lies in how leaders participate. Jobs himself addressed this in an interview when asked if he made all the decisions about product design: \u0026ldquo;I wish I did, but that\u0026rsquo;s what makes Apple the largest startup in the world.\u0026rdquo;\nUltimately, the role of a leader in Founder Mode is to ensure that everyone rows in the same direction with maximum force—not by dictating how they hold the paddle, but by being present, guiding alignment, and keeping the team focused on the larger vision.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/founder-mode/","summary":"Great leadership is not absence; presence","title":"Brian Chesky and Founder Mode"},{"content":"I have a deep respect for the founders at my company; otherwise, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t still be here. From my perspective, they\u0026rsquo;re all remarkable leaders. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t contradict the point of this article: idolizing your founder, leader, or anyone else—whether they\u0026rsquo;re Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, or anyone else—is a mistake. The reason is simple: they\u0026rsquo;re not superhuman, no one is.\nOne common misconception is that leaders possess greater technical skill than frontline employees, and people attribute that to their leader\u0026rsquo;s promotion. But leadership is just a different role. It demands a distinct skill set—one that\u0026rsquo;s often rarer and generally more difficult, which tends to earn higher compensation. But that\u0026rsquo;s all there is to it.\nIn an ideal work environment, the leader shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the one making every decision. If they are, it typically means one of two things:\nThey\u0026rsquo;re micromanaging, or They\u0026rsquo;ve hired people who can\u0026rsquo;t outperform them in specialized areas. Neither scenario is ideal. Instead, a good leader functions as a \u0026ldquo;provider of hidden information\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;big-picture decision-maker.\u0026rdquo; Their value lies in vision, strategy, objective-setting, and people skills—not in expertise within every specific domain.\nRecognizing that leaders are simply playing a different role clarifies why idolizing them is risky.\n1. Idolization Leads to Emotional Extremes\nWhen we put leaders on a pedestal, we become prone to emotional extremes. If you believe your leader is right in every decision, eventually reality will show you otherwise. This disillusionment often leads people to the opposite extreme, viewing the leader as entirely flawed. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this happen repeatedly, and it usually stems from a lack of perspective—a tendency to see leaders as all-knowing, which leaves little room for objective evaluation.\n2. Idolization Can Make You Lose Your Position\nThe best organizations are made up of extraordinary people who excel in their specific areas, and a leader who brings them together and guides the big picture. If you believe your leader is a superhuman, you may start to doubt your own value, perhaps wishing they could be cloned to handle your role, too. But viewing your leader\u0026rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses realistically allows you to better complement their abilities. Great leaders are often self-aware enough to acknowledge their own weaknesses and encourage you to fill in those gaps. But many leaders lack this level of self-awareness, so it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to understand the team\u0026rsquo;s objectives, identify the leader\u0026rsquo;s blind spots, and find your best contribution.\n3. Objectivity Helps You Learn What Leadership Really Involves\nBy dropping the idolization, you can begin to learn what good leadership actually entails. Leaders make big, impactful decisions—and they also make mistakes, often ones that aren\u0026rsquo;t immediately obvious. The only way to understand their decision-making is to examine the trade-offs, anxieties, hesitations, and sometimes even the irrationality behind their choices. Attributing your leader\u0026rsquo;s decision to \u0026ldquo;genius\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;innate talent\u0026rdquo; won\u0026rsquo;t help you grow. But understanding the practical, often messy reality of leadership just might. Most of the time, you\u0026rsquo;re more like them than you might think.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/no-pedestals/","summary":"Resist the urge to place founders or leaders on pedestals; it hinders growth and critical thinking.","title":"Don't Put the Founder on a Pedestal—Or Anyone Else"},{"content":"Self Management for Effective Leaders How should you manage your time? In one sentence: A leader\u0026rsquo;s job is to ensure the team produces the outcomes that matter most to the company.\nTo break this down, there are four key areas:\nObjective: Identifying what\u0026rsquo;s important and what\u0026rsquo;s not. Strategy: Creating a step-by-step plan to achieve the objective. Executive Management: Ensuring everyone is rowing in the same direction and removing bottlenecks. People Management: Maintaining morale, positioning people for success, and managing hiring and firing. Objective I spend at least 40% of my most productive hours reading, learning, and analyzing the market and technology trends. This is to ensure we have an objective that\u0026rsquo;s both feasible and critical. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough: leaders need to spend more time thinking about what to do than simply doing things. This is particularly important in this era, when things change in a rate which we can\u0026rsquo;t imagine. Keep doing something that\u0026rsquo;s not important has huge opportunity costs.\nStrategy Once you have an objective (or your boss gives you one), strategy becomes essential. Great outcomes rarely happen in one strike. You need a clear step-by-step plan to achieve the goal. Without this, you risk harming your team\u0026rsquo;s performance and morale when early attempts fail. Developing strategy also falls under the 40% of time spent on thinking and planning.\nExecutive Management This is the least glamorous part of leadership—it\u0026rsquo;s repetitive, action-heavy, and often boring. But it compounds over time. You get better at it day by day.\nI spend my \u0026ldquo;not-so-productive\u0026rdquo; hours here: listening to reports, talking to users, speaking with frontline developers, and using the product myself. I minimize indirect reports because they make me lose touch with the ground truth. If a product is underperforming, don\u0026rsquo;t delegate your way out of the problem—use it yourself and talk to users. Lead by example so your team does the same.\nPeople Management People management rarely feels urgent until something goes wrong—like when you need to fire someone or deal with attrition. When it becomes a problem, however, it should be your top priority.\nSam Altman once said the highest ROI for a leader is in hiring. My contrarian view is that I don\u0026rsquo;t trust HR for this task—not just here but in general. Hiring is too important to delegate to someone who has little understanding of your business. The risk is too high.\nUse HR as a tool: let them handle logistics like posting jobs and managing processes. But as a leader, you should proactively seek out great talent yourself. You should know where to find the best people because you are one of them.\nHow should you manage your reports This question depends heavily on your personality and the type of business you\u0026rsquo;re running. For example, my leader doesn\u0026rsquo;t endorse all of my methods—he has his philosophy, and it works for him but not quite for me. My approach is rooted in two principles:\nBeing Detail-Oriented Being Importance-Oriented 1. Being Detail-Oriented Being detail-oriented does not mean micromanaging. For a better understanding, you can refer to my blog on Brian Chesky and Founder Mode .Being detail-oriented means you need to know as much as possible—if not all—about the projects you\u0026rsquo;re overseeing, both technical and non-technical. This is easier than it sounds.\nHowever, you must control the urge to manage every detail directly. If you fail to do this, you\u0026rsquo;ll make life miserable for the people working for you and, worse, erode their initiative—which is critical to building a sustainable organization.\nBeing detail-oriented also requires that you talk directly to the people doing the actual work, not their managers. Bureaucracy thrives when you need to talk to a VP, who then relays the request to a middle manager, who finally asks the people writing the code. This chain is inefficient and prone to information loss.\nSkipping the reporting line is often treated as a taboo in many organizations. But I believe this taboo exists mainly to protect incompetent managers. The people on the front lines are what I call the ground truth of your business. You have no excuse not to access that truth directly.\nOne huge advantage of being detail-oriented is that you can use your unique influence to unblock bottlenecks. Businesses often stall not because the people are incompetent but because they face obstacles they can\u0026rsquo;t resolve on their own. Due to bureaucracy or inertia, they might not ask for help, allowing these bottlenecks to persist. As a leader, being detail-oriented allows you to identify and eliminate these issues effectively.\n2. Being Importance-Oriented Being importance-oriented means ensuring that most of your team\u0026rsquo;s efforts are directed toward solving the most important problem at any given time. A common mistake is when people work hard but on things that don\u0026rsquo;t matter, leading to poor outcomes overall.\nThis is a task only leaders can do because it requires having a broader perspective of the entire business to determine what\u0026rsquo;s important and what\u0026rsquo;s not.\nBeing detail-oriented helps here, too. You can only verify whether your team is working on the most critical problem if you\u0026rsquo;re close to the details. Without this connection, you risk leading the team in the wrong direction.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/self-management-effective-leaders/","summary":"Leadership isn\u0026rsquo;t about innate traits but cultivated skills, especially self-management.","title":"Self Management for Effective Leaders"},{"content":" This is a redacted excerpt from an internal letter I wrote, with all sensitive information removed or masked.\nReaffirming Strategic Principles: Prioritization of Objectives, Trade-Offs on Different Objectives, and Building a Chain of Interconnected Actions\nPrinciple 1: Step by Step The core of a \u0026ldquo;step-by-step\u0026rdquo; approach lies in dynamically shifting perspectives as we make modular progress, ensuring we don\u0026rsquo;t lose the synergy of an integrated business ecosystem. Segmenting different business functions helped avoid internal bottlenecks. Now, in developer product development, \u0026ldquo;step-by-step\u0026rdquo; means avoiding extremes of modularity that isolate teams and instead ensuring that each move integrates tightly with the rest. This step-by-step approach guarantees that our actions form an interconnected chain of progress, rather than haphazard rushes forward.\nEach major product update or expansion initiative should prompt a critical question: Have we connected with all the business lines or resources we have? Are we leveraging the advantages of our integrated ecosystem? Are we laying groundwork for future ecosystem alignment?\nCoordinating closely with other business lines incurs a cost, and we need to acknowledge it. In simple terms, weak performance in one line can pull down others, which means we might not expand modularly as fast as possible. Instead, we must develop the ability to manage increasingly complex loops. By steadfastly building these feedback loops, we enhance the advantages of our integrated ecosystem over the long term, turning them into our core differentiator.\nThe step-by-step principle is also a powerful counter to \u0026ldquo;quick-win\u0026rdquo; expansion strategies. Let\u0026rsquo;s avoid being misled by performance metrics like DAU or MAU, at least for now. Remember: ten users who love you are more valuable than a hundred who only kind of like you. And where does user loyalty come from? From leveraging our ecosystem\u0026rsquo;s strengths.\nLeveraging vertical integration on a smaller scale helps us concentrate our strengths even if, overall, our ecosystem is less mature than competitors\u0026rsquo;. This lets us compete from a stronger position on our chosen ground.\nPrinciple 2: Proximate Goals All leaders have a crucial responsibility: to simplify complex and ambiguous problems and present them in a solvable form for their organization. Many leaders fall short here, often declaring ambitious goals without properly mapping out the obstacles. Taking responsibility doesn\u0026rsquo;t only mean owning up to mistakes but also setting achievable, proximate goals that offer the organization solvable challenges. — Good Strategy, Bad Strategy\nAmbitious goals can drive excitement, but they can also cause confusion and fear. Without achievable, smaller goals, our engineers don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear starting point. We must empower frontline teams with decision-making power, while also reducing the ambiguity they face. Break down goals into tasks whenever possible. Focusing on proximate goals over grand visions keeps the team moving forward.\nProximate goals also provide timely motivation. Building a new business will be a long-term endeavor. We can\u0026rsquo;t expect constant, strong positive feedback from the market, so setting and achieving smaller goals gives our team the positive reinforcement crucial for morale.\nPrinciple 3: Go-To-Market Multiple Times Ninety percent of product ideas are bad—what matters is how quickly you realize they are. — Marc Randolph, Co-founder of Netflix\nConstant market engagement has three main benefits:\nPreventing insularity and creating products people actually need Using new products to probe true market needs (the \u0026ldquo;scouting\u0026rdquo; approach), Testing the reliability of our internal teams. Developing products is like running social experiments. Genius product managers don\u0026rsquo;t create universally-needed products out of thin air; the market is our lab. The faster we obtain real results, the clearer our differentiation from competitors will be. Mark Zuckerberg once said that building products is a turn-based strategy game and the winning secret is to ship it fast to have more turns than others. Accelerate problem exposure, increase visibility of issues, and ensure everyone is accountable for what they build and understands the use cases deeply.\nGetting market feedback is an art. We can\u0026rsquo;t let market requests dictate every move or become tunnel-visioned on internal development goals. The answer is neither, but in accelerating our frequency of market engagement, reducing bias in feedback, and identifying core demands.\nPrinciple 4: Build a User Culture Recognizing that product development will be long-term means understanding that we need an exceptional, durable team. As we noted, we\u0026rsquo;re still in the early stages; the real competition will be even tougher.\nAny member indifferent to user needs or uninterested in the business trajectory could hinder the team down the line. Building a strong team will also be a long-term commitment; rapid turnover of team members would only be another version of the \u0026ldquo;quick-win\u0026rdquo; fallacy. Promoting a strong user culture is a necessity, not an option.\nWhy is this essential?\nIf we\u0026rsquo;re empowering frontline engineers, they must understand user needs deeply; otherwise, they\u0026rsquo;re just following product requirement docs. Eliminate any go-between roles that separate engineers from users; these roles only add noise and delays. Principle three—Go-To-Market Multiple Times—is best served by \u0026ldquo;building in public,\u0026rdquo; where engineers can directly address feedback and bugs. If an engineer can\u0026rsquo;t explain their work clearly, it indicates a need for deeper understanding. This level of clarity is necessary before delegation can be effective. Principle 5: Stay Objective Long-term competition tests our mindset: neither despair nor overconfidence are helpful. To maintain realistic assessments and a steady outlook, we must remind ourselves to stay objective.\nObjectively Assess the Gaps Stay informed of competitor dynamics. Where possible, try competitor products firsthand and monitor market feedback. Avoid being misled by competitors\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;smoke-and-mirrors\u0026rdquo; updates, and keep a realistic view of market prospects and competition intensity.\nRecognize the Twisting Path of Progress Progress is not linear. We\u0026rsquo;re not omniscient and will have to continuously adapt. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall into the trap of assuming \u0026ldquo;A will lead to B.\u0026rdquo; New features won\u0026rsquo;t automatically bring users; multiple factors could be at play. Our aim should be to test widely and cheaply.\nNegative feedback is still feedback. Being criticized by users is better than market silence; it proves that our needs assessment was somewhat accurate.\nPrinciple 6: Stay Attuned to Opportunities Growth over the long term follows a exponential curve, with bursts of short-term volatility. Opportunities are unpredictable, and to grow, we must be prepared to seize them. Our ability to capture these moments must be continually maintained.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/principles-product-development/","summary":"A redacted excerpt from an internal letter on product strategy.","title":"Six Principles to Build a Great Product"},{"content":"One of the most common criticisms of Asian parenting is the lack of unconditional encouragement.\nImagine a Chinese student scoring 90 out of 100 on a final exam—a solid achievement by most standards. Yet, in many cases, this student might face one of two responses. The harsher type of parent might immediately focus on the lost 10 points, saying things like, \u0026ldquo;Why can others score higher than 90, but you can\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Do you realize how many people will outscore you in the Gaokao (the Chinese College Entrance Exam) if you keep losing points like this?\u0026rdquo; The more considerate type of parent might start with a brief compliment, \u0026ldquo;You did a good job,\u0026rdquo; but then quickly pivot to a debriefing session: \u0026ldquo;Now, let\u0026rsquo;s analyze why you missed those 10 points. Can you be less careless next time?\u0026rdquo;\nBoth types of parents believe they\u0026rsquo;re acting out of love and doing what\u0026rsquo;s best for their child. In Chinese culture, pride is often seen as a slippery slope to complacency, and complacency is viewed as one of the most dangerous mindsets. So, these parents feel an almost moral obligation to nip any signs of pride in the bud. They fear that if they don\u0026rsquo;t, they\u0026rsquo;ll be failing to prepare their child for the future.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s be honest—what are the odds that the child will actually take this advice to heart and become less careless in the future? The chances are slim to none. If the child is proud of their achievement, they\u0026rsquo;re likely in a celebratory mood, eager to share their success with their parents out of love and a desire for validation. If your child no longer shares their successes with you, that\u0026rsquo;s a clear sign of a deeper issue in your relationship—don\u0026rsquo;t doubt that.\nAs a parent, the best course of action in this moment is simple: celebrate with your child. Why? Because your \u0026ldquo;constructive feedback\u0026rdquo; won\u0026rsquo;t be valued or even heard. The child will either ignore or resent the advice, resent you for pouring cold water on their happiness, or even start to dislike the project itself because it brought them no sense of achievement.\nIf you want someone to improve at anything, you must first build a positive reinforcement loop. This includes offering genuine, unconditional praise when they succeed. If you truly want your child to get better, save the constructive feedback for a setting where they themselves acknowledge that their performance was below expectations. It\u0026rsquo;s even better if your child comes to you seeking advice after things go wrong—but that level of trust requires a solid foundation.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve said here doesn\u0026rsquo;t just apply to parenting—it applies to the workplace and all human interactions. Providing advice is an art that requires careful consideration of how, when, and where you do it. Dumping advice without regard for the situation might make you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re being honest, objective, and promoting a growth mindset. But in reality, you\u0026rsquo;re just satisfying a didactic craving and reflecting a sense of arrogance. Most of the time, people aren\u0026rsquo;t in the right frame of mind to receive feedback, and your untimely advice will only backfire.\nThis blog\u0026rsquo;s insight gave credits to my discussion with Helen.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/constructive-feedback/","summary":"Protect the positive reinforcement loop if you really wish others to grow","title":"How to Provide Advice in a Helpful Way"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been delving into the phenomenon known as Steve Jobs\u0026rsquo; reality distortion field, trying to grasp how he pulled it off. This led me to an intriguing insight, partly inspired by a famous TED Talk by Simon Sinek.\nMediocre salespeople sell products—they make you buy a thing. Good salespeople sell a lifestyle—they make you buy into an idea. But the truly extraordinary, those who often become charismatic leaders, they sell visions—they sell the \u0026ldquo;why.\u0026rdquo;\nI find it astonishing that most people don\u0026rsquo;t proactively think of the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; in their own work. They complain about being treated like tools in a corporate machine, yet they willingly instrumentalize themselves. They\u0026rsquo;ve programmed their minds to function like a tool: receive input, produce the desired output, repeat. They don\u0026rsquo;t question why the work is being done, in what context it adds value, or whether there might be a better way. They clock in, complete the tasks assigned, submit their work, and do it all over again the next day. How can anyone be surprised when the corporate machine treats them like a tool if that\u0026rsquo;s the life they\u0026rsquo;ve chosen?\nIn our workplace, there\u0026rsquo;s a principle we call the 7/2/1 rule. It means that in an ideal business unit, 70% of the people are focused on the tasks handed to them—the what. Their role is to take the inputs and deliver quality outputs. 20% are tasked with figuring out the best way to accomplish those tasks—the how. And the remaining 10% engage in the strategic discussions, deciding what to do and why to do it—the why. In real-world practice, I find it\u0026rsquo;s more like a 85/10/5 division.\nThe brutal reality is that many people struggle to find a \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; in their work or life. This sense of meaninglessness is, in part, a byproduct of capitalism\u0026rsquo;s rise and the decline of religion. Yet, people need a \u0026ldquo;why.\u0026rdquo; And if you can be the person who identifies a compelling \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; and sells it to others, they\u0026rsquo;ll work tirelessly for it—and it won\u0026rsquo;t even be about the money.\nThis is where strong, influential leadership comes into play. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly what Jobs did when he convinced John Sculley to leave Pepsi for Apple: \u0026ldquo;Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?\u0026rdquo; Apple\u0026rsquo;s vision—affordable, delicatedly designed personal computers—was a much stronger \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; than selling soda.\nThe world isn\u0026rsquo;t short of hardworking, intelligent, and well-trained people. But only a few possess the agility to adapt to the market change, the strategic vision to see ahead, and the charisma to sell those \u0026ldquo;whys\u0026rdquo; to both employees and customers.\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/selling-whys/","summary":"Find a compelling why and sell it.","title":"Selling Whys"},{"content":"A truly natural impulse I quickly discovered my passion for writing, which I enjoy even more than reading. My father, a former writer turned entrepreneur, likely influenced me. I started writing at a young age in elementary school, with poetry as my first love.\nWriting feels more like a natural impulse than a duty. If I don\u0026rsquo;t write, I feel discomfort. With countless thoughts circling in my mind, writing provides a release, almost like a cure.\nI recognize the benefits of writing: it helps in reorganizing thoughts, formulating structured ideas, and consolidating understanding, as Feynman emphasized in his learning method. However, these benefits don\u0026rsquo;t push me to write. I write because I feel uneasy if I don\u0026rsquo;t. I truly believe that\u0026rsquo;s how humanity works for most people: a habit is sustainable only if it feels like a constant, urgent demand from within. Merely stating \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s a good habit to have\u0026rdquo; rarely motivates people to adopt it.\nI used to organize my thoughts using the iPhone\u0026rsquo;s native memo app. But as I graduated from college, my thoughts became more complex and systematic, beyond what a simple memo could handle. So, I decided to start blogging.\nA window for people to know me, aka personal branding Whenever I meet a new interesting person, or catching up with some old friends, I really do have a lot to share, and those sharing are generally less about news but more about learnings. As I met more interesting people daily (a good sign!), I felt the repetition of introducing my learnings has been annoying enough that I wanted some form of automation, and blogging seems to be a great way to do it.\nBlogging also helps me build a personal brand. I believe personal branding is an underestimated asset in its impact and overestimated in its cost. Like any other asset, personal branding yields compound interest. Starting early on the path of exponential growth can lead to significant rewards in the end.\nI\u0026rsquo;m lazy, uninterested, and incompetent in other form of medias (music, art, video, and others), which makes blogging a no-brainer.\nPractice writing Even though I often claim I\u0026rsquo;m bilingual in both Chinese and English, I must confess I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at both in writing very concise, elegant articles (I admire George Orwell for that). Often times my English writing sounds Chinese-translated, and vice versa. In reality, my natural writing style is a blend of both languages.\nGiven that the potential audience of this blog primarily uses Chinese and English, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to make the blog bilingual. This will also help me practice and improve my writing skills in both languages.\nOn originality I won\u0026rsquo;t claim much originality in my writing. Most of my content is a personal reinterpretation of ideas from great minds I admire. I draw inspiration mainly from the works of Elon Musk, Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Brain Chesky, Steve Jobs and Naval Ravikant, among others.(keep adding on this list..)\n","permalink":"https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/why-i-write-blogs/","summary":"Exploring the motivations behind blogging, from clarifying thoughts to sharing knowledge.","title":"Why I Write Blogs?"}]
