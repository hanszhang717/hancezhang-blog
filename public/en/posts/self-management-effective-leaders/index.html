Effective Leaders<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#self-management-for-effective-leaders>#</a></h1><h2 id=how-should-you-manage-your-time>How should you manage your time?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-should-you-manage-your-time>#</a></h2><p>In one sentence: <strong>A leader&rsquo;s job is to ensure the team produces the outcomes that matter most to the company.</strong></p><p>To break this down, there are four key areas:</p><ol><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Identifying what&rsquo;s important and what&rsquo;s not.</li><li><strong>Strategy</strong>: Creating a step-by-step plan to achieve the objective.</li><li><strong>Executive Management</strong>: Ensuring everyone is rowing in the same direction and removing bottlenecks.</li><li><strong>People Management</strong>: Maintaining morale, positioning people for success, and managing hiring and firing.</li></ol><h3 id=objective>Objective<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#objective>#</a></h3><p>I spend at least 40% of my most productive hours reading, learning, and analyzing the market and technology trends. This is to ensure we have an objective that&rsquo;s both feasible and critical. I can&rsquo;t stress this enough: leaders need to spend more time thinking about <strong>what to do</strong> than simply doing things. This is particularly important in this era, when things change in a rate which we can&rsquo;t imagine. Keep doing something that&rsquo;s not important has <strong>huge opportunity costs</strong>.</p><h3 id=strategy>Strategy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#strategy>#</a></h3><p>Once you have an objective (or your boss gives you one), strategy becomes essential. Great outcomes rarely happen in one strike. You need a clear step-by-step plan to achieve the goal. Without this, you risk harming your team&rsquo;s performance and morale when early attempts fail. Developing strategy also falls under the 40% of time spent on thinking and planning.</p><h3 id=executive-management>Executive Management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#executive-management>#</a></h3><p>This is the least glamorous part of leadership—it&rsquo;s repetitive, action-heavy, and often boring. But it compounds over time. You get better at it day by day.</p><p>I spend my &ldquo;not-so-productive&rdquo; hours here: listening to reports, talking to users, speaking with frontline developers, and using the product myself. I minimize indirect reports because they make me lose touch with the ground truth. If a product is underperforming, don&rsquo;t delegate your way out of the problem—use it yourself and talk to users. Lead by example so your team does the same.</p><h3 id=people-management>People Management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#people-management>#</a></h3><p>People management rarely feels urgent until something goes wrong—like when you need to fire someone or deal with attrition. When it becomes a problem, however, it should be your top priority.</p><p>Sam Altman once said the highest ROI for a leader is in hiring. My contrarian view is that I don&rsquo;t trust HR for this task—not just here but in general. Hiring is too important to delegate to someone who has little understanding of your business. The risk is too high.</p><p>Use HR as a tool: let them handle logistics like posting jobs and managing processes. But as a leader, you should proactively seek out great talent yourself. You should know where to find the best people because you are one of them.</p><h2 id=how-should-you-manage-your-reports>How should you manage your reports<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-should-you-manage-your-reports>#</a></h2><p>This question depends heavily on your personality and the type of business you&rsquo;re running. For example, my leader doesn&rsquo;t endorse all of my methods—he has his philosophy, and it works for him but not quite for me. My approach is rooted in two principles:</p><ol><li><strong>Being Detail-Oriented</strong></li><li><strong>Being Importance-Oriented</strong></li></ol><h3 id=1-being-detail-oriented>1. Being Detail-Oriented<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-being-detail-oriented>#</a></h3><p>Being detail-oriented does <strong>not</strong> mean micromanaging. For a better understanding, you can refer to my blog on <a href=https://www.hancezhang.blog/en/posts/founder-mode/>Brian Chesky and Founder Mode </a>.Being detail-oriented means you need to know as much as possible—if not all—about the projects you&rsquo;re overseeing, both technical and non-technical. This is easier than it sounds.</p><p>However, you must control the urge to manage every detail directly. If you fail to do this, you&rsquo;ll make life miserable for the people working for you and, worse, erode their initiative—which is critical to building a sustainable organization.</p><p>Being detail-oriented also requires that you talk directly to the people doing the actual work, not their managers. Bureaucracy thrives when you need to talk to a VP, who then relays the request to a middle manager, who finally asks the people writing the code. This chain is inefficient and prone to information loss.</p><p>Skipping the reporting line is often treated as a taboo in many organizations. But I believe this taboo exists mainly to protect incompetent managers. The people on the front lines are what I call the <strong>ground truth</strong> of your business. You have no excuse not to access that truth directly.</p><p>One huge advantage of being detail-oriented is that you can use your unique influence to unblock bottlenecks. Businesses often stall not because the people are incompetent but because they face obstacles they can&rsquo;t resolve on their own. Due to bureaucracy or inertia, they might not ask for help, allowing these bottlenecks to persist. As a leader, being detail-oriented allows you to identify and eliminate these issues effectively.</p><h3 id=2-being-importance-oriented>2. Being Importance-Oriented<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-being-importance-oriented>#</a></h3><p>Being importance-oriented means ensuring that most of your team&rsquo;s efforts are directed toward solving the <strong>most important problem</strong> at any given time. A common mistake is when people work hard but on things that don&rsquo;t matter, leading to poor outcomes overall.</p><p>This is a task only leaders can do because it requires having a broader perspective of the entire business to determine what&rsquo;s important and what&rsquo;s not.</p><p>Being detail-oriented helps here, too. You can only verify whether your team is working on the most critical problem if you&rsquo;re close to the details. Without this connection, you risk leading the team in the wrong direction.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://hancezhang.blog/en/>Hance Zhang's Blog</a></span> ·
